## Module 1
**_What went well?_**
The assignment went smoothly. I was able to run the app locally and add users and tweets into the database without too much trouble.

**_What was interesting/surprising?_**
I was surprised as how simple it was to create the app. I think we only needed 5 lines of code to get started.

**_What was challenging?_**
Like the other lectures, I had to find some translations from mac to windows. As far as understanding the material goes, I'll need to look into exactly what's going on here. I feel comfortable that I know the steps, but I'm a little shakey on what's going on behind the scenes.

## Module 2
**_What went well?_**
Creating the function to add users to my local database went well.

**_What was interesting/surprising?_**
Connecting to the API and seeing all of the methods available was interesting. I was surprised on how much data Twitter made avaiable to be analyzed. Location, device, etc. It feels a little invasive.

**_What was challenging?_**
Working with CSS and the html is a little daunting. Nothing we've done so far feels complicated, but I've never had any experience with it, so there's a lot to learn.

## Module 3
**_What went well?_**
Integrating our predictive model into the app went smoothly.

**_What was interesting/surprising?_**
How easily everything fits together. I had an idea in my head of what it takes to make a functional web app, and this is a lot more straightforward than I thought.


**_What was challenging?_**
The most difficult part was finding all of my typos. Missing capitalization, using lower case when I should be capitalizing.
