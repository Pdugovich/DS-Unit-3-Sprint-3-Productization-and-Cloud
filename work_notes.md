## Module 1
**_What went well?_**
The assignment went smoothly. I was able to run the app locally and add users and tweets into the database without too much trouble.

**_What was interesting/surprising?_**
I was surprised as how simple it was to create the app. I think we only needed 5 lines of code to get started.

**_What was challenging?_**
Like the other lectures, I had to find some translations from mac to windows. As far as understanding the material goes, I'll need to look into exactly what's going on here. I feel comfortable that I know the steps, but I'm a little shakey on what's going on behind the scenes.
